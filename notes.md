- what are web components?
  - combination of custom elements, html templates, and shadow dom
    - https://www.webcomponents.org/specs
  - allow us to publish semantic, encapsulated html elements that have everything they need to work bundled inside
- why web components?
  - framework agnostic
  - semantics (easier to reason about than random divs everywhere)
  - supported on firefox 63+, chrome 67+, safari 10+, edge 76+, ie11+ (with polyfill)
- specification
  - constructor (cannot render stuff)
  - connectedCallback
    - invoked when element is added to DOM, so we can safely render inside the web component
    - delay rendering, fetching, etc to this part of the lifecycle
  - disconnectedCallback
    - invoked when element is deleted from DOM
    - use this to do cleanup like unregister event handlers to avoid memory leaks
  - attributeChangedCallback
    - attributes are the only logical way to pass data into your web component
    - whenever an attribute on your web component changes externally, this function will be called
      - has the attribute name, old value, and new value
  - adoptedCallback
    - invoked when parent document changes, mainly used for iframes
